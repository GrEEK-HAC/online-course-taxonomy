# Online course taxonomy philosophy

Who knew subjects would be so subjective!

The goal of this document is to provide an open source framework for online education taxonomies. The majority of MOOC’s and OER’s center around the idea of high quality highly available education that is closely aligned with college level material. Therefore, It should seem logical to fit a taxonomy that is as parallel to a college level curriculum as possible. The open source and editable nature of the project should see to it that no one subjective opinion can bias the collection. 

In order to remain dynamic with the growing set of courses, the taxonomy should be built to scale outside of the standard set of subjects or categories. This can be achieved by setting a threshold by which a topic can be become a category or top level subject. 

Finally, a data-set of keywords should be aggregated to allow ease of decision making when assigning a course to a category or subject. The data-set will also allow for the inclusion of NLP (natural language processing) techniques and auto-tagging in the user’s application.
