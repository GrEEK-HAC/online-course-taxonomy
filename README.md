# A Taxonomy for Online Courses

The goal of this document is to provide an open source framework for online education taxonomies. 

## Who Are We?

At [Class Central](https://www.class-central.com/), we aggregate thousands of free online courses also know as Massive Open Online Courses or MOOCs. MOOCs have brought affordable, university-level learning experiences to willing students across the world, free from the constraints of geography and socioeconomic status. For the first time in history, courses that were limited to a small number of students are now open to anyone in the world with an Internet connection. 

With a simple interface and thousands of reviews we have helped more than 2.5 million people around the world decide which online course to next. We are building an ecosystem around these courses to help guide learners towards their education goals.

## Why We Did This

We believe that learners are not always sure what they want. The most searched keyword on Class Central is [python](https://www.class-central.com/search?q=python) while the most popular course is [Learning How To Learn](https://www.class-central.com/mooc/2161/coursera-learning-how-to-learn-powerful-mental-tools-to-help-you-master-tough-subjects). The courses that people want to take are not always the ones that they search for.

For learners to be a able to stumble upon courses that they didn't know exist, a well defined taxonomy is crucial. On top of this taxonomy, we limit our catalogue by only allowing courses that meet a quality bar. This enhances the discovery process. You can find the taxonomy live on our subjects page below:

[Class Central Subjects Page](https://www.class-central.com/subjects)

## Philosophy

The majority of MOOC’s and OER’s center around the idea of high quality highly available education that is closely aligned with college level material. Therefore we designed the taxonomy that is as parallel to a college level curriculum as possible. 

The taxonomy is a three level hirearchy in discreasing order: subjects, categories, keywords.

Though the current version reflects the current crop of online courses, it is built to be dynamic with the growing set of courses. We achieve this by setting a threshold by which a topic can be become a category or top level subject i.e if a topic has more than 20 courses its promoted to a category and if a category has 100 courses it is promoted to a Subject.

Finally, we aggregate a data-set of keywords to allow ease of decision making when assigning a course to a category or subject. Currently the process of categorzing a course is done manually. But in the future, this data-set will also allow us to automate this process.
